# Linear-regression-car-price
Predicting car prices using Linear Regression in Python
# Linear Regression -Car Price Dataset 

## Short Description
This project explores car price prediction using Linear Regression. It involves data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Car Price Dataset 
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook /Google colab
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Installing

Use the following to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

```
## Running the Tests

### Breakdown of Steps in the Notebook:
- Load the car price dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using plots and correlations
- Clean the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Train a Linear Regression model
- Evaluate the model using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error
- Visualize predictions vs actual values

### To Run the Notebook:
- Open the `.ipynb` file using **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**
- Run each cell from top to bottom to see the complete analysis and results
